Credit Card Restrictions for Irish Customers:· To better protect our Irish customers, and as part of our internal safer gambling initiatives, we have also committed to no longer accepting top ups or deposits from Credit Cards to your account.· From the 31st of March 2021, we will no longer accept credit card deposits to Irish accounts.· We will continue to accept deposits from Revolut cards and alternative payment methods such as Paysafe cards or Neteller as usual, however any deposits which originate from a credit card will not be accepted.· You can still withdraw funds to the Credit Cards attached to your account.

The Visa security measure is referred to as Verified by Visa. Across the banking industry these new security measures are referred to as 3D Secure. As all banks roll out these new security measures over the next few months it will be necessary to use 3D Secure on all websites, in the same way that Chip & Pin is required in retail outlets. What is Verified by Visa? Visa have developed a new anti-fraud scheme to reduce the risk of a customer's card being used fraudulently. It works by means of a secret password, much like your PIN, which you choose. From now on you will be asked to enter your password before your card can be used to make a purchase online. This means that even if someone does manage to get hold of your card details, they won't be able to use them online without knowing your password. How do I get my Password? If you have not already set up your password, the next time you attempt to deposit to Paddy Power using your credit or debit card, you will be prompted to register for Verified by Visa Securecode. You will be asked to input your card details and some other personal information to prove your identity. This varies by bank but may include information such as your date of birth, your mother's maiden name or your credit limit. Although you are inputting this information via the Paddy Power website, you are communicating directly with your bank through a secure link, so Paddy Power or anyone else does not see this information. You will also be asked to create a password. This password must include alphabetic characters and numbers. Once you have created the password you will be able to use this password for all future payments on any website, much like you use your PIN to make withdrawals at ATMs, or make purchases in shops. It is therefore important that you remember this password. If you do forget it, your bank can assist you in changing it. Does this Apply to all Cards? It depends on your bank when this will occur. If your bank has not yet implemented it, you will not be required to go through this process and can continue to deposit as normal.

The MasterCard security measure is referred to as Mastercard Securecode. Across the banking industry these new security measures are referred to as 3D Secure. As all banks roll out these new security measures over the next few months it will be necessary to use 3D Secure on all websites, in the same way that Chip & Pin is required in retail outlets. What is Mastercard Securecode? Mastercard have developed a new anti-fraud scheme to reduce the risk of a customer's card being used fraudulently. It works by means of a secret password, much like your PIN, which you choose. From now on you will be asked to enter your password before your card can be used to make a purchase online. This means that even if someone does manage to get hold of your card details, they won't be able to use them online without knowing your password. How do I get my Password? If you have not already set up your password, the next time you attempt to deposit to Paddy Power using your credit or debit card, you will be prompted to register for Mastercard Securecode. You will be asked to input your card details and some other personal information to prove your identity. This varies by bank but may include information such as your date of birth, your mother's maiden name or your credit limit. Although you are inputting this information via the Paddy Power website, you are communicating directly with your bank through a secure link, so Paddy Power or anyone else does not see this information. You will also be asked to create a password. This password must include alphabetic characters and numbers. Once you have created the password you will be able to use this password for all future payments on any website, much like you use your PIN to make withdrawals at ATMs, or make purchases in shops. It is therefore important that you remember this password. If you do forget it, your bank can assist you in changing it. Does this Apply to all Cards? It depends on your bank when this will occur. If your bank has not yet implemented it, you will not be required to go through this process and can continue to deposit as normal. Once your bank enables Verified by Visa and Mastercard Securecode, you will be required to register your password.

It is a fair method of recalculating bets that have already been placed when suddenly a horse is withdrawn. For example, if you bet on the second favourite to win a race at 5/1, but the favourite withdraws just before the race, then your chances of winning suddenly shoot up. To adjust for the non-runners, Rule 4 calculates what the true odds of each remaining horse now are. Don’t worry, you won’t have to do anything when Rule 4 kicks in but it’s worth being aware of the clause in case you’re banking on a specific return from the race. DOES RULE 4 AFFECT MY PAYOUT?If Rule 4 is implemented in a race you have bet on then your payout might be affected. However, this depends on the horse that withdrew and the size of the race. For example, if a horse priced at 33/1 withdraws from a race involving 18 runners then Rule 4 would not be implemented, as the effect on the rest of the field is minimal. However, were the 7/2 favourite to withdraw from a race at Cheltenham involving just seven runners then Rule 4 would kick in. Effectively, the shorter the odds of the non-runner, the bigger the Rule 4 deduction becomes. Your settled bet will show the Rule 4 deduction which has been applied. RULE 4 EXCEPTIONSYou can get a racing betting exception to Rule 4s if you bet on the ante-post markets. These are odds that are listed before the full race list is announced and are often used by punters looking to bet on races weeks and months in advance. HOW TO CALCULATE RULE 4Calculating Rule 4 can be tricky–and realistically you’re not expected to do it yourself! It all depends on the price of the non-runner and the strength of the field. However, as a general rule this table explains the basic Rule 4 deductions. Example:If you had a bet on a horse for £10 at 10/1 that went on to win, but in the same race the favourite (priced at 2/5) pulled out, your total return would be:Pre 'Rule 4'£10 x 10 = £100 (profit pre 'Rule 4')£100 + £10 = £110 (total return pre 'Rule 4')Post Rule 4£100 less 70% (70p in the £) = £30 (profit post 'Rule 4')£30 + £10 = £40 (total return post 'Rule 4')In races where more than one horse is withdrawn, the deduction will not exceed 90p per £1 (or 90%). You can also use the Paddy Power Bet Calculator and click on the Rule 4 button to help predict your potential payout.","length":2428,"tokens":598,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Horse Racing - Withdrawn Horse - Rule 4Still not clear?","post_url":"https://helpcenter.paddypower.com/app/answers/detail/p/6/a_id/1355/","post_date":"","post_type":"mini","content":"WHAT IS RULE 4?Rule 4 is simply a deduction that is made to winning bets, when the race is impacted by a horse not running.

This will help you understand how your bet will be settled. PassOpta define a pass as any intentional played ball from one player to another. Passes include open play passes, goal kicks, corners and free kicks played as pass – but exclude crosses, keeper throws and throw-ins. Opta adds a whole range of qualifiers to each pass event, so that various things can be measuredChipped pass – a lofted ball where there is a clear intended recipient, must be over shoulder height and using the passes height to avoid opposition players. Headed pass – a header where there is a clear intended recipient. Launch – a long high ball into space or into an area for players to chase or challenge for the ball. Flick-on – a glancing pass with head or foot onto a team mate where the ball is helped on in the same general direction. Pull back – a pass inside the penalty area which is pulled back from the goal-line to the centre of the penalty area. Lay-off – a first time pass away from goal when there is pressure on the passer (Typically played by a forward) with one touch when they have their back to goal. Through Ball – a pass splitting the defence for a team-mate to run on to. Tap pass – a short pass after a dead ball situation which cannot have a lost outcome. Each pass is logged with X and Y co-ordinates for its point of origin and destination. All Player Passes bets are settled on the basis of 90 minutes’ play (plus injury time) unless otherwise stated. For any Player Passes bets, all bets placed on players that do not take part in the match will be void. Players will be deemed a participant should they enter the game at any point in 90 minutes play plus injury time.

You can cancel your Snake Draft contest entry until the contest fills (e. g. in a 6-person Snake Draft, you can cancel your entry until the 6th person joins). Snake Draft contests start when filled (e. g. in a 6-person Snake Draft, the contest begins when the 6th person joins). After the last person joins, there is a 60-second buffer period before the first person is up to draft. If your Snake Draft contest does not fill in time to start and finish before slate lock, your entry fee is refunded. Lock TimesSnake Drafts must start and finish before the slate locks. The exact time that a Snake Draft must start by depends on the size of the contest and the slate lock time. The calculation is: Slate lock time - [(30 seconds) x (number of picks) + 60 seconds] = Latest possible Snake Draft start timeE. g. a 3-person Snake Draft for a 7 pm slate must begin by 6:50 pm (7 pm - [(30 seconds) x (18 picks) + 60 seconds] = 6:50 pm). The Basics of DraftingIn a Snake Draft, you draft your lineup in real time against your opponents. The pick order is random and reverses each round (e. g. if you have the first pick in round one, you will have the last pick in round two). You have 30 seconds to make each pick. If you do not make a pick in 30 seconds, a pick will be made for you. Once a player has been drafted, no one else may draft that player. You cannot edit your lineup after the Snake Draft ends. For Multi Game Slates: You and your opponents draft six players each for slates with two or more games. You must draft the following positions for slates with two or more games:You must draft players from at least two teamsYou may not pick more than four players from the same team. For Single Game SlatesYou and your opponents draft three players each for single-game slates. You must draft the following positions for single-game slates:You must draft players from both teams. The Queue and Auto-DraftWhen it is not your turn to pick, you can add players that you want to draft to your queue. If you turn on Auto-Draft, you will not receive push notifications, and picks will be automatically made for you based on:The top-ranked player in your queue, orThe highest-projected available player in the player list, if your queue is emptyIf you do not make a pick in your allotted time, a pick will be made for you, based on the same criteria. Protections Against Picking Injured PlayersPlayers with the following injury statuses will never be auto-picked for you:NFL: Injured Reserve / Not Active / OutNBA: Injured Reserve / Not Active / OutMLB: Injured List / Not Active / OutNHL: Injured Reserve / Not Active / OutPGA: Not Active / OutYou can manually draft players with these injury statuses after confirming your choice.

The full time result is the result for this market irrelevant of the number of minutes added on. In the event of a player not playing, all bets will be made void once they do not take any part in the match. If the player comes on they will be treated as a runner for bets upon which they can be successful ie. Anytime Goalscorer, Wincast. If a player has any opportunity to fulfil the bet they are counted as a runner, irrelevant of how long they have played. Own Goals: If the first goal is an own goal it does not count as a goal for settlement purposes of 1st goalscorer and subsequent markets attached to it. All bets on 1st goalscorer will therefore be settled on the 2nd goal. Own goals will not effect the settlement of any bets placed on correct score or other related markets. Time Intervals: We offer a wide range of markets based on time intervals in in-running bets. The first minute is 0:00 – 0:59. Example: A goal to be scored up to and including the 27th minute. If the goal is scored after 27:15 it will be counted as a loser as it was scored in the 28th minute. Postponements: If a match is postponed, or a match starts but is later abandoned, all undetermined bets will be voided as long as the match is not played to a finish before midnight local time on its scheduled date. Fixtures that are rearranged before the scheduled kick off date will not be regarded as postponements and all bets will stand, as long as the rescheduled date is within 72 hours of the original kick off time. 90-minute (normal-time) Rule: All bets in football are accepted on the basis that they are for 90 minute betting and extra time does not count for settlement purposes unless it has been clearly stated within the market. Example: Team A beats Team B 2-1 after extra time in a cup game. The match ended 1-1 after 90 minutes. The correct winning selection in the win-draw-win market is “Draw”. All bets on Team A will be losers despite them qualifying for the next round. We offer a market “To qualify for the next round” within cup games, this will take every eventuality into account. Popular Footall betsScorecasts: A scorecast is a bet on a player to score the first goal along with predicting the correct score. If the player does not start the game and subsequently comes on after the first goal has been scored or takes no part at all the bet will be settled as a correct score single at the price offered on the scoreline at the time of bet placement. Note we do not fully void a scorecast if the player does not partake in the game. Scorecasts must be placed via a special market listed not as a correct score and first goalscorer double. By scrolling through the markets for a particular match the bottom market will generally be “Wincast” above this is market with 2 dropdown menus. You can place Scorecasts via this market. Simply select your first goalscorer from the left menu and score from the right menu. Clicking on the price offered on the right handside will generate the selection to the betslip. Wincast: This is a bet on a player to score in 90 minutes and the nominated team to win the game. It slightly differs to a scorecast in that it is completely voided if the player does not take part. It is not settled as a single on the team to win. Half Time/Full Time: You are backing one selection to be leading or for it to be a draw at half time and to win/draw the match. Example: Team A v Team B. The match is 1-1 Half Time and Team A ends up winning the game 2-1 the winning selection will be Draw/Team A. Accumulators When placing an accumulator you are backing a stipulated number of teams all to win. If one is unsuccessful the bet will be treated as a loser. Accumulator bets are very simple to place. Simply individually select each selection you wish to back, generating them onto the betslip. Once this is done you have to put your stake in the box marked “accum. (1)” under the betting options heading. The one in brackets indicates that only one bet is being placed. The key to placing any multiple is to get every selection onto the betslip before thinking about stakes or bet permutations. Insurebet First Goalscorer: Within this market you are having a bet on your selection to score first at slightly reduced odds compared to first goalscorer – win or each way. If your selection does not score the first goal but subsequently scores later in the match your stake will be refunded. Bet Builder: Bet builder allows you to combine multiple bets on the same game, such as over or under goals and corners, both teams to score, correct score, goalscorers, or even who you think could get carded or have a shot on target. All selections must win for the bet to be considered a winner. Even better - up to 4 bet builders on different matches can be combined as a Multi Bet Builder.","length":4953,"tokens":1106,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Football quick guideStill not clear?","post_url":"https://helpcenter.paddypower.com/app/answers/detail/p/6/a_id/196/","post_date":"","post_type":"mini","content":"90 Minute Betting: 90 minute betting is inclusive of all additional time played by the referee due to injuries and delays during the match.

Although Opta make every effort to ensure their data collection is as accurate as possible, they can sometimes review the statistics and make amendments. So, while it may appear as a shot on target on our site, this could change once the final review is complete. See below for a list of Opta definitions accompanied by short explanations. This will help you understand how your bet will be settled. Shot on Target Opta define a shot on target as any goal attempt that: Goes into the net regardless of intent. Is a clear attempt to score that would have gone into the net but for being saved by the goalkeeper or is stopped by a player who is the last line of defence with the goalkeeper having no chance of preventing the goal (last line block). Shots that are blocked by another player, who is not the last line of defence, are not deemed to be shots on target. Shots that hit any part of the frame around the goal are not counted as shots on target, unless the ball subsequently goes into the back of the net and is officially awarded as a goal. There are other examples where it isn’t easy to confirm whether a shot is deemed a shot on target or not. We have listed numerous different scenarios of shot types below and specified whether they are regarded as a shot on target or not. Please note this list is just a guide. The final decision is confirmed by Opta, and we settle all our markets based off their data: Shot Off Target A shot off target is defined as any clear attempt to score that: Goes over or wide of the goal without making contact with another player. Would have gone over or wide of the goal but for being stopped by a goalkeeper's save or by an outfield player. Directly hits the frame of the goal and a goal is not scored. Blocked shots are not counted as shots off target. Blocked Shot A blocked shot is defined as any clear attempt to score that: Includes shots blocked unintentionally by the shooter’s own team mate. Clearances off the line by an opposition player (last line blocks) are counted as shots on target and do not get counted as a blocked shot. Goal Assist For settlement purposes, a player will be deemed to have assisted a goal if OPTA adjudicates that they have done so. A goal assist means the final touch leading to the recipient of the ball scoring a goal. If the final touch is deflected by an opposition player, the initiator is only given a goal assist if the receiving player was likely to receive the ball without the deflection having taken place. If a player wins a penalty or a free kick that leads to a goal, it does not count as an assist. Body Part for Goals/Shots The following four body parts are collected: Right foot, left foot, head and other. Foot includes any connection with the leg. Location for Goals/Shots The position of the ball, when the shot is taken (shot origin): Inside or outside the 6-yard boxInside or outside the 18-yard boxAny event happening on a line, will be considered inside that area. For example, a shot on the 18-yard line will count as being inside the box","length":3149,"tokens":669,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Football - Shots On Target - Opta DefinitionsStill not clear?","post_url":"https://helpcenter.paddypower.com/app/answers/detail/p/6/a_id/4080/","post_date":"","post_type":"mini","content":"IntroductionWe use a 3rd party data provider called ‘Opta’ to settle our Shot & Shot on Target markets.

Tattersalls Rule 4 may apply. Paddy Power offer Non-Runner Money Back on selected Future Racing races all year-round. After a race becomes Non-Runner No Bet, any Future Racing bets placed on the Win or Each-Way market will be refunded if your selection does not run.

If your selection does not score the first goal but subsequently scores later in the match your stake will be refunded. Own goals do not count for settlement purposes. Own goalsIf the first goal is an own goal it does not count as a goal for settlement purposes. All bets on first goalscorer will therefore be settled on the next goal scored. Own goals do not effect the settlement of any bets placed on correct score or other related markets. A goal will be considered an own goal if it is officially recognised as such on the day of the game - subsequent decisions by the dubious goals panels do not affect settlement. Your player doesn't start or is subbedIf your player doesn't start and there has already been a first goalscorer decided before they come on then your first goalscorer bet is void. If they come on and no first goalscorer has been decided yet then it is still a valid bet as they still have an opportunity to score the first goal. Each wayPaddypower offer each way goalscorer bets - we pay each way odds for five places. This can be 1/3, 1/4 or 1/5 the odds depending on the match. If your player doesn't score the first but does score 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th goal then you will be paid at the each way odds. Remember, own goals do not count so it is the first five goals that are scored disregarding any own goals. Anytime goalscorerYour bet is that your player will score at any time during the match. Usual 90 minutes rule apply and own goals do not count for settlement purposes. Your player doesn't start or is subbedIf a player has any opportunity to fulfil the bet they are counted as a runner, regardless of how long they have played. This means that if your player goes off injured in the first minute and hasn't scored they are deemed a loser; likewise, if your player comes off the bench late on and doesn't score they are also deemed a loser. Scorecast/WincastScorecast: A scorecast is predicting the first goalscorer and the correct score. Scorecasts must be placed via a special market listed not as a correct score and first goalscorer double. When you scroll down through the markets for a particular match the market at the bottom will generally be 'Wincast' above this is a market with two dropdown menus - this is where you place your Scorecast. Simply select your first goalscorer from the left menu and score from the right menu. Clicking on the price offered on the right-hand side will generate the selection to the betslip. We do not fully void a scorecast if the player does not partake in the game instead the bet is settled as a correct score single. The first goalscorer part of the bet is governed by the same rules as first goalscorer single bets - own goals do not count and if your player either comes on before the first goal is scored or goes off without scoring, the entire bet is deemed as a loser. Wincast: This is a bet on a player to score in 90 minutes and the nominated team to win the game. It slightly differs from a scorecast in that it is completely voided if the player does not take part, it is not settled as a single on the team to win.

Tattersalls Rule 4 may apply. Are there any exceptions to the Future Racing non-runner rules? In line with principals laid down by Tattersalls Rules of Racing, Future Racing bets will be void under the following circumstances, otherwise bets stand:If the race is abandoned or declared void. If the venue of the race is altered or postponed to a later date at a different track. If the race is postponed to a later date at the same track with entries totally reopened bets placed after the initial entries are void, but bets placed prior to the initial entry stage will stand.

The liability of a layer against horses remaining will be reduced on both win and place parts of such bets, in accordance with the rate to be announced before the race by Tattersalls Committee, dependent on the odds currently available against the withdrawn horses at the time of withdrawal.

These special odds will supersede the accumulative odds calculated from the individual event prices irrespective of the fact that the individual event prices may be endorsed on the slip. If special odds were not available, the stake will be divided equally as singles at the prices available at the time the bet was placed. Any horse that does not qualify for, or is expunged from a race, will be settled as a loser.

Looking to multiply those winnings? Simply add the relevant number of selections to the betslip. Then add your stake beside the multiple bet type you wish to place. The more selections you add to your betslip, the more bet permutations will be available on your bet. FAQ What's the difference between a multi and a Bet Builder bet? A Bet Builder bet allows you to combine bets from the same game. Multis, accumulators and permutation bets allow you to combine selections from different matches, races or events. What happens if one leg is void?If any selection in any leg is a non-runner or otherwise void (e. g. Player doesn’t play, game is cancelled, horse doesn’t run) then bets on that individual leg will be void and your multiple will be re-priced accordingly. For example, a treble including one void leg will become a double. If that voided leg means that an individual bet within a multiple becomes a single bet, then this single bet will stand. Types of fixed odds multiplesA Single is a bet on one selection. Your selection must be successful to have a return. A Double is one bet on two selections in different events. Both selections must be successful to have a return. A Treble is one bet on three selections in different events. All three selections must be successful to have a return. A Trixie consists of four bets on three selections in different events i. e. 3 Doubles and 1 Treble. Two or more selections must be successful to have a return. Remember a €1/£1 Trixie costs €4/£4. A Patent consists of seven bets on three selections in different events i. e. 3 Singles, 1 on each selection, 3 Doubles and 1 Treble. One or more selections must be successful to have a return. Remember a €1/£1 patent costs €7/£7. An Accumulator is the simplest multiple bet: you have two or more selections and you need them all to win to get a return. A two-selection accumulator is also known as a Double and a three selection accumulator is also known as a Treble. A four-selection accumulator is known as a Fourfold Accumulator. The maximum numbers of selection permitted in a multiple bet is 20, which is a twentyfold accumulator bet. A £1 Accumulator costs £1 - the returns depend on the prices of the selections chosen. A Fourfold Accumulator is one bet on four selections in different events. All four selections must be successful to have a return. A Yankee consists of eleven bets on four selections in different events i. e. 6 Doubles, 4 Trebles and 1 Fourfold Accumulator. Two or more selections must be successful to have a return.

A €1/£1 Lucky 15 costs €15/£15. A Fivefold Accumulator is one bet on five selections. All five selections must be successful to have a return. A Super Yankee or Canadian consists of twenty-six bets on five selections i. e. 10 Doubles, 10 Trebles, 5 Fourfold Accumulators and 1 Fivefold Accumulator.

Why Might your Cash Out not be Working or Available? Cash Out isn't available for all markets on our Sportsbook. But, it's available for a lot! If cash out becomes unavailable to you, it is most likely for one of the following reasons:Your cash out value is less than the Free Bet stake you’ve used, cash out will be available again if the value increases. The market you’ve bet on does not have cash out available (eg. some Power Prices, football handicap markets)The market does not go in-play (eg. #WhatOddsPaddy)The market is suspended temporarily due to match incidents and market suspension. eg: when prices are changing after a goal, VAR, break point, try etc. If the bet features multiple in-play games, the risk of suspension increases and more patience may be required. The third-party provider who covers the sporting event has unfortunately not been able to continue coverage, as originally agreed. Pricing and cash out have been lost as a result.

How to Change Odds FormatBelow is a table highlighting the difference between the two:FractionsWhenever you see two numbers separated by a slash, i. e. 10/1, this is a fractional betting odd. Fractional odds allow you to calculate how much money you will win on your bet in comparison to you stake. The number on the left(e. g. 10) is how much you will win. The number on the right is how much you need to stake. for every £/€1 you bet, you will win £/€9. This can also be calculated as 1 / (9 + 1) = 0.10 - There is a 10% chance that the event will happen. for every £/€1 you bet, you will win £/€1. This can also be calculated as 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.50 - There is a 50% chance that the event will happen. for every £/€4 you bet, you will win £/€1.

DecimalsWhenever you see odds displayed in numeric form i. e. 9.00, this is a decimal betting odd. Decimal odds allow you to calculate how much money you will be returned should your bet win.

What this essentially means is that to get your returns you need to divide the reported dividend by two and then multiply it by your stake. A Handy ExampleYou place £10 on Paddy's Boy in Race 10 at Santa Anita and it romps home. You patiently wait for the dividend to come through as you know that US Racing cannot be settled until after the official result is known. At last you see a dividend of 10.6 - to find out your returns divide this by 2 and multiply by your stake:10.6/2 = 5.3 x 10 = Returns of £53. What else do I need to know?Place/Show bettingSo you think your horse has a chance but it may not win and you decide that place betting is the way to go. With US racing this is slightly different to what you might be used to. You need to look at the number of runners in the race:1-4 runners - Win Only5-7 runners - Place pool8+ runners - Show poolWhen you look at the results from a US track you will see a Win dividend, a Place Pool dividend and a Show Pool Dividend. If you have placed a Place/Show bet on the race and your horse has placed then if the race contains 5-7 runners you will be paid on the Place pool dividend (remember to divide that dividend by two) and if the race contains eight or more runners then you will be paid the Show Pool dividend. One more thing you might not be aware ofCoupled HorsesIn American racing, horses can be \"coupled\" from having the same owner. This means that out of both horses, whichever result is better counts as the result for both horses in all US Tote markets. This only applies to Tote markets. Any bets on any markets where we offer our own Fixed Odds price (including if you opt to take the Paddy Power SP) will be settled on the official result without coupling.

Given that settlement of this market depends on getting full, classified results, these markets will not be settled until approximately one hour after the race has finished. Settlement of the market will be in accordance with the official result as displayed on www. sportinglife. com. The refund refers specifically to if the horse falls, unseats the jockey or is brought down – no other description will apply to this market. Price offered is for the horse to win the race.","content_length":911,"content_tokens":185,"embedding":[]},{"post_title":"Faller InsuranceStill not clear?","post_url":"https://helpcenter.paddypower.com/app/answers/detail/p/6/a_id/177/","post_date":"","post_type":"mini","content":"If the horse falls, unseats the jockey or is brought down the bet stake is returned.

Bets for the remaining horses in the race will be subject to a deduction in accordance with Tattersalls R4(c) based on the Win price of the withdrawn horse(s) at the time of withdrawal. E. g. Horse X priced at 4/1 in the win market and 11/4 in the Faller Insurance market is withdrawn then a R4 deduction of 20c based on the 4/1 Win price shall apply to the Faller Insurance market.
