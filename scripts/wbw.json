For more information, click here Do Paddy Power allow deposit by Instant Bank Transfers? Yes! For more information on Instant Bank Transfers, a payment method powered by Open Banking, which can offer both Instant Deposits and Instant Withdrawals to eligible customers, please click here. Why is my deposit being declined?If your card deposit is being declined, it is because the card issuer is denying us permission to take funds from your card/bank account. Sometimes, if you make multiple online transactions, your card issuer will refer transactions for manual authorisation to ensure the integrity of the card. If this is the case, our customer service team may be able to deposit manually for you. You can contact them using the ‘Message Us’ button at the bottom of this page. If this isn't the case, the card issuer is declining the transaction for another reason. There are several reasons why this may happen. You will need to contact your bank to discuss this as they will not share that information with us. Why am I receiving extra security checks when making a deposit? Your card issuer/bank may ask you to complete extra security checks when making payments online. This is due to a regulatory change made from: • Ireland: 31st December 2020 • UK: 14th September 2021 The regulation applies to electronic payments throughout all countries within the European Economic Area (EEA), including card deposits made with Paddy Power. This means that, before processing your deposit, you may be asked to confirm that it is you attempting to make the payment. Depending on who you bank with, this will be presented to you differently (E. G. Visa is Verified by Visa, Mastercard is Mastercard SecureCode, American Express is SafeKey, etc) This is known as Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), and it's a new way that banks are helping to protect consumers from fraud. SCA will most often be completed through your mobile banking app, if you use it, or otherwise with a one-time passcode or a card reader. If this is the first time you have attempted a deposit with your card since the regulatory changes were made, you may be asked to set up your password in order to be taken through SCA in future. Please follow the instructions to get this set up and make a deposit. If you are having problems with this, you will need to contact your card issuer. We recommend that your contact details are kept up to date both on your Paddy Power account and with your bank to ensure there are no issues with this process.","length":5209,"tokens":1094,"chunks":[{"post_title":"Deposit QueriesWhy is my deposit being declined?Still not clear?","post_url":"https://helpcenter.paddypower.com/app/answers/detail/p/6/a_id/1894/","post_date":"","post_type":"post","content":"With Paddy Power, you can deposit using a variety of payment methods in a swift and easy process!

Credit Card Restrictions For UK Customers: · Outside of our own Safer Gambling initiatives, the laws in the UK have changed, which means that betting companies can’t accept top-ups to your account from Credit Cards. We’re fully supportive of the changes and won’t be taking any funds that come from Credit Cards from the 14th of April 2020. · Additionally, as per UK Gambling Commission guidance, this restriction for UK customers also includes any deposits or top-ups to accounts made via alternative methods such as PayPal, PaySafe cards, etc; in cases where the balance was initially funded by Credit Cards.· You can still withdraw funds to the Credit Cards attached to your account. Credit Card Restrictions for Irish Customers:· To better protect our Irish customers, and as part of our internal safer gambling initiatives, we have also committed to no longer accepting top ups or deposits from Credit Cards to your account.· From the 31st of March 2021, we will no longer accept credit card deposits to Irish accounts.· We will continue to accept deposits from Revolut cards and alternative payment methods such as Paysafe cards or Neteller as usual, however any deposits which originate from a credit card will not be accepted.· You can still withdraw funds to the Credit Cards attached to your account. Debit is the New Credit!Don’t worry though, we can still accept debit cards as usual (the ones that use money from your bank account) – so if you don’t have one of them linked to your account, we’d recommend setting one up now.

The Visa security measure is referred to as Verified by Visa. Across the banking industry these new security measures are referred to as 3D Secure. As all banks roll out these new security measures over the next few months it will be necessary to use 3D Secure on all websites, in the same way that Chip & Pin is required in retail outlets. What is Verified by Visa? Visa have developed a new anti-fraud scheme to reduce the risk of a customer's card being used fraudulently. It works by means of a secret password, much like your PIN, which you choose. From now on you will be asked to enter your password before your card can be used to make a purchase online. This means that even if someone does manage to get hold of your card details, they won't be able to use them online without knowing your password. How do I get my Password? If you have not already set up your password, the next time you attempt to deposit to Paddy Power using your credit or debit card, you will be prompted to register for Verified by Visa Securecode. You will be asked to input your card details and some other personal information to prove your identity. This varies by bank but may include information such as your date of birth, your mother's maiden name or your credit limit. Although you are inputting this information via the Paddy Power website, you are communicating directly with your bank through a secure link, so Paddy Power or anyone else does not see this information. You will also be asked to create a password. This password must include alphabetic characters and numbers. Once you have created the password you will be able to use this password for all future payments on any website, much like you use your PIN to make withdrawals at ATMs, or make purchases in shops. It is therefore important that you remember this password. If you do forget it, your bank can assist you in changing it. Does this Apply to all Cards? It depends on your bank when this will occur. If your bank has not yet implemented it, you will not be required to go through this process and can continue to deposit as normal.

The MasterCard security measure is referred to as Mastercard Securecode. Across the banking industry these new security measures are referred to as 3D Secure. As all banks roll out these new security measures over the next few months it will be necessary to use 3D Secure on all websites, in the same way that Chip & Pin is required in retail outlets. What is Mastercard Securecode? Mastercard have developed a new anti-fraud scheme to reduce the risk of a customer's card being used fraudulently. It works by means of a secret password, much like your PIN, which you choose. From now on you will be asked to enter your password before your card can be used to make a purchase online. This means that even if someone does manage to get hold of your card details, they won't be able to use them online without knowing your password. How do I get my Password? If you have not already set up your password, the next time you attempt to deposit to Paddy Power using your credit or debit card, you will be prompted to register for Mastercard Securecode. You will be asked to input your card details and some other personal information to prove your identity. This varies by bank but may include information such as your date of birth, your mother's maiden name or your credit limit. Although you are inputting this information via the Paddy Power website, you are communicating directly with your bank through a secure link, so Paddy Power or anyone else does not see this information. You will also be asked to create a password. This password must include alphabetic characters and numbers. Once you have created the password you will be able to use this password for all future payments on any website, much like you use your PIN to make withdrawals at ATMs, or make purchases in shops. It is therefore important that you remember this password. If you do forget it, your bank can assist you in changing it. Does this Apply to all Cards? It depends on your bank when this will occur. If your bank has not yet implemented it, you will not be required to go through this process and can continue to deposit as normal.
