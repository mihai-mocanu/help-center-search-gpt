This means that if you have deposited into your Betfair account using one payment method, you will have to withdraw back onto that same payment method. You'll notice that every time you make either a deposit or a withdrawal, the 'Net Deposits' figure on your card details page relating to that payment method, will change. Your 'Net Deposits' are the difference between the 'Total Deposits' and the 'Total Withdrawals' that you have made from each payment method, such as a debit card. Total Deposits - Total Withdrawals = Net Deposits If you have deposited more than you have withdrawn to a payment source, you will have Positive Net Deposits. If you have deposited less that you have withdrawn to a payment method, you will have Negative Net Deposits. If you have used more than one payment method, for example, a debit card and a PayPal account, you will need to balance any Positive Net Deposits on both methods, before you can withdraw more than you have deposited on either method. Example Situation: You have deposited €70 from your Visa Card and €50 from your PayPal Account into your Betfair account.

After some betting success, the 'Available to Withdraw' balance on your account is €500, and you want to withdraw €150. You would prefer to withdraw this €150 to your PayPal Account, but before you can do this, you will need to 'Close the Loop' and balance the Positive Net Deposits on your Visa Card. Therefore, you need to withdraw €70 back onto your Visa Card, making the Net Deposits on that payment method €0, before you can withdraw the rest onto your PayPal Account. If, using the above example, you would prefer to withdraw the €150 back onto your Visa Card, you would still need to withdraw €70 onto your Visa Card and the €50 back onto your PayPal before exceeding the Net Deposit.

For more information, click hereDo Betfair allow deposit by Instant Bank Transfers?Yes! For more information on Instant Bank Transfers, a payment method powered by Open Banking, which can offer both Instant Deposits and Instant Withdrawals to eligible customers, please click here. Why is my deposit being declined?If your card deposit is being declined, it is because the card issuer is denying us permission to take funds from your card/bank account. If you receive the message \"transaction declined, please speak to your card issuer\", your bank has declined the transaction. Your bank will never give a specific reason to Betfair for declining the transaction therefore we can only suggest you check to make sure that the expiry date has been entered correctly on your Betfair account or try an alternative card or payment method. Failing this, you will need to contact your bank to discuss the matter further. Why am I receiving extra security checks when making a deposit?Your card issuer/bank may ask you to complete extra security checks when making payments online. This is due to a regulatory change made from: • Ireland: 31st December 2020 • UK: 14th September 2021 The regulation applies to electronic payments throughout all countries within the European Economic Area (EEA), including card deposits made with Betfair. This means that, before processing your deposit, you may be asked to confirm that it is you attempting to make the payment. Depending on who you bank with, this will be presented to you differently (E. G. Visa is Verified by Visa, Mastercard is Mastercard SecureCode, American Express is SafeKey, etc) This is known as Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), and it's a new way that banks are helping to protect consumers from fraud. SCA will most often be completed through your mobile banking app, if you use it, or otherwise with a one-time passcode or a card reader. If this is the first time you have attempted a deposit with your card since the regulatory changes were made, you may be asked to set up your password in order to be taken through SCA in future. Please follow the instructions to get this set up and make a deposit. If you are having problems with this, you will need to contact your card issuer.
