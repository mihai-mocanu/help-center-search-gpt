      "content": "There are two types of bank transfer that we offer, a standard bank transfer and an instant bank transfer. What are the main differences, benefits and timescales between a standard and an instant transfer?Standard Bank Transfers take between 1 & 5 days to reach your Paddy Power account (deposits) or your bank account (withdrawals). After your first Instant Bank Transfer (which can take up to 90 minutes), subsequent deposits & withdrawals are immediate. The minimum deposit amount is lower on an instant transfer (£/€5 vs £/€20 on standard) The minimum withdrawal amount is also lower on an instant transfer (£/€0.01 vs £/€10 on standard)Instant transfers are much quicker to set up as you can do all the verification checks using your banking app whereas the standard transfer asks you to put input your bank details so you will need these to handIn both instances, payments are authenticated directly with your bank and personal details are never stored or shared with anyone. Are there any fees associated with Bank transfers?Fees do not generally apply to either type of transfer. However, with standard transfers you have a daily limit as to the amount you can send. If you go above the daily limit, the transfer could be rejected, and a fee applied. This limit should be detailed at the time on the deposit/withdrawal page when making the transfer. How do I register for instant bank transfer?It’s easy! You don't need to input your bank account details like account number or IBAN to register, you simply add Instant Bank Transfers as a deposit method and link your bank account to your Paddy Power account.

Are there any fees associated with Bank transfers?Fees do not generally apply to either type of transfer. However, with standard transfers you have a daily limit as to the amount you can send.

Below are the guidelines for debit/credit card withdrawals and bank transfer withdrawals that are made during a bank holiday weekend: *Generally, withdrawals take 2-3 working days to reach your account. If a bank holiday falls during this time it may take an extra day. Please note that, due to bank processing times, sometimes withdrawals can take up to 5 working days to reach your account. All made before 10.30am will reach your Bank account that Same Day, otherwise the funds will reach your bank account Next day. If the withdrawal was made on a bank holiday you will need to add an extra day. All made before 10.30am will be processed as ‘Next Day’ and will reach your bank account the Next day. Otherwise it will take 2 days. If the withdrawal was made on a bank holiday you will need to add an extra day. All will take 3-5 days to reach the customers bank account. If the withdrawal was made on a bank holiday you will need to add an extra day.",

      "content": "Due to regulations, Paddy Power operate what's called a 'Closed Loop Policy' when it comes to withdrawing funds. This means that if you have deposited into your Paddy Power account using one payment method, you will have to withdraw back onto that same payment method. You'll notice that every time you make either a deposit or a withdrawal, the 'Net Deposits' figure on your card details page relating to that payment method, will change. Your 'Net Deposits' are the difference between the 'Total Deposits' and the 'Total Withdrawals' that you have made from each payment method, such as a debit card. Total Deposits - Total Withdrawals = Net DepositsIf you have deposited more than you have withdrawn to a payment source, you will have Postive Net Deposits. If you have deposited less than you have withdrawn to a payment method, you will have Negative Net Deposits. If you have used more than one payment method, for example, a debit card and a PayPal account, you will need to balance any Positive Net Deposits on both methods, before you can withdraw more than you have deposited on either method. Example Situation:You have deposited €70 from your Visa Card and €50 from your PayPal Account into your Paddy Power account. Therefore, your Net Deposits from your Visa Card are €70, and your Net Deposits from your PayPal Account are €50. After some betting success, the 'Available to Withdraw' balance on your account is €500, and you want to withdraw €150. You would prefer to withdraw this €150 to your PayPal Account, but before you can do this, you will need to 'Close the Loop' and balance the Positive Net Deposits on your Visa Card. Therefore, you need to withdraw €70 back onto your Visa Card, making the Net Deposits on that payment method €0, before you can withdraw the rest onto your PayPal Account. If, using the above example, you would prefer to withdraw the €150 back onto your Visa Card, you would still need to withdraw €70 onto your Visa Card and the €50 back onto your PayPal before exceeding the Net Deposit.

More Information here. How long does it take for my withdrawal to process? If you are making a card withdrawal to a card that does not offer the faster withdrawal service, it can take between 2-5 working days to reach your bank. However, weekends and bank holidays are not deemed working days which you'll need to consider when working out when you'll receive your payment. Please see the table below for a guide around when you should receive your withdrawal:*Please note that the above timescales are given as estimations. In a small number of cases, these timescales can be extended due to factors outside our control, e. g. incorrect expiry dates, old card details etc. Faster withdrawal methods (such as Visa Direct) enable customers to withdraw their funds instantly or within 2 hours. For more information on our withdrawal timescales, view our methods & limits article here My withdrawal is still not in my bank account, even after 5 working days have passed. What do I do?If your funds have not appeared in your bank account after 5 working days have passed, contact our Customer Support Team using the ‘Message Us’ button at the bottom of this article. We can place a trace on the transaction for you. For more information on missing withdrawals, read our article here. How can I check on the status of/cancel my withdrawal? Withdrawals which are not yet processed will be displayed under “Pending Withdrawals” (to get to this section of our site, follow steps 1 & 2 under the ‘How to make a withdrawal’ heading above and select the ‘Pending Withdrawals’ tab instead of ‘Popular’ or ‘Other Methods’). You can only cancel your card withdrawal if you are not a UK or Irish Customer: Why can't I always choose how I withdraw my funds?Under our closed loop policy, you must withdraw to each payment method at least the total amount deposited before you are able to withdraw any 'additional' winnings via another chosen payment method. More Information here. Another reason may be that you have not yet deposited on Paddy Power with the payment method you want to withdraw to. A deposit is required to ‘activate’ the payment method for use. This deposit can be immediately withdrawn if required. Why can't I use my card for withdrawals?There are numerous reasons why a card withdrawal may not be processed: You have not met the requirements of the closed loop policySome UK issued MasterCards do not provide “collection account” details. This means the issuer has not made available an underlying account for us to pay money back to. You are using a MasterCard issued outside of countries listed below. You are using a MasterCard issued within countries listed below but you are trying to withdraw more than what you deposited using that card. (See our closed loop policy)You are using a Visa card issued in a country or from a creditor where withdrawals are not permitted. Depending on which of the above applies to your account, you may be able to choose an alternate payment method to withdraw your funds. However you may be required to complete some security checks before being allowed to continue. If you are unsure, please contact Customer Service using the ‘Message Us’ button at the bottom of this article. List of MasterCard issued countries where withdrawals are accepted: United Kingdom, Ireland, Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Gibraltar, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, Norway, Romania, San Marino, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey.

If this is the case, our customer service team may be able to deposit manually for you. You can contact them using the ‘Message Us’ button at the bottom of this page. If this isn't the case, the card issuer is declining the transaction for another reason. There are several reasons why this may happen. You will need to contact your bank to discuss this as they will not share that information with us. Why am I receiving extra security checks when making a deposit? Your card issuer/bank may ask you to complete extra security checks when making payments online. This is due to a regulatory change made from: • Ireland: 31st December 2020 • UK: 14th September 2021 The regulation applies to electronic payments throughout all countries within the European Economic Area (EEA), including card deposits made with Paddy Power. This means that, before processing your deposit, you may be asked to confirm that it is you attempting to make the payment. Depending on who you bank with, this will be presented to you differently (E. G. Visa is Verified by Visa, Mastercard is Mastercard SecureCode, American Express is SafeKey, etc) This is known as Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), and it's a new way that banks are helping to protect consumers from fraud. SCA will most often be completed through your mobile banking app, if you use it, or otherwise with a one-time passcode or a card reader. If this is the first time you have attempted a deposit with your card since the regulatory changes were made, you may be asked to set up your password in order to be taken through SCA in future. Please follow the instructions to get this set up and make a deposit. If you are having problems with this, you will need to contact your card issuer. We recommend that your contact details are kept up to date both on your Paddy Power account and with your bank to ensure there are no issues with this process.",

Credit Card Restrictions For UK Customers: · Outside of our own Safer Gambling initiatives, the laws in the UK have changed, which means that betting companies can’t accept top-ups to your account from Credit Cards. We’re fully supportive of the changes and won’t be taking any funds that come from Credit Cards from the 14th of April 2020. · Additionally, as per UK Gambling Commission guidance, this restriction for UK customers also includes any deposits or top-ups to accounts made via alternative methods such as PayPal, PaySafe cards, etc; in cases where the balance was initially funded by Credit Cards.· You can still withdraw funds to the Credit Cards attached to your account. Credit Card Restrictions for Irish Customers:· To better protect our Irish customers, and as part of our internal safer gambling initiatives, we have also committed to no longer accepting top ups or deposits from Credit Cards to your account.· From the 31st of March 2021, we will no longer accept credit card deposits to Irish accounts.· We will continue to accept deposits from Revolut cards and alternative payment methods such as Paysafe cards or Neteller as usual, however any deposits which originate from a credit card will not be accepted.· You can still withdraw funds to the Credit Cards attached to your account. Debit is the New Credit!Don’t worry though, we can still accept debit cards as usual (the ones that use money from your bank account) – so if you don’t have one of them linked to your account, we’d recommend setting one up now.

      "content": "New security measures are being implemented by the two leading credit card companies Mastercard and Visa. The Visa security measure is referred to as Verified by Visa. Across the banking industry these new security measures are referred to as 3D Secure. As all banks roll out these new security measures over the next few months it will be necessary to use 3D Secure on all websites, in the same way that Chip & Pin is required in retail outlets. What is Verified by Visa? Visa have developed a new anti-fraud scheme to reduce the risk of a customer's card being used fraudulently. It works by means of a secret password, much like your PIN, which you choose. From now on you will be asked to enter your password before your card can be used to make a purchase online. This means that even if someone does manage to get hold of your card details, they won't be able to use them online without knowing your password. How do I get my Password? If you have not already set up your password, the next time you attempt to deposit to Paddy Power using your credit or debit card, you will be prompted to register for Verified by Visa Securecode. You will be asked to input your card details and some other personal information to prove your identity. This varies by bank but may include information such as your date of birth, your mother's maiden name or your credit limit. Although you are inputting this information via the Paddy Power website, you are communicating directly with your bank through a secure link, so Paddy Power or anyone else does not see this information. You will also be asked to create a password. This password must include alphabetic characters and numbers. Once you have created the password you will be able to use this password for all future payments on any website, much like you use your PIN to make withdrawals at ATMs, or make purchases in shops. It is therefore important that you remember this password. If you do forget it, your bank can assist you in changing it. Does this Apply to all Cards? It depends on your bank when this will occur. If your bank has not yet implemented it, you will not be required to go through this process and can continue to deposit as normal. Once your bank enables Verified by Visa and Mastercard Securecode, you will be required to register your password. You can contact your bank for further details on when they plan to implement it.",

Across the banking industry these new security measures are referred to as 3D Secure. As all banks roll out these new security measures over the next few months it will be necessary to use 3D Secure on all websites, in the same way that Chip & Pin is required in retail outlets. What is Mastercard Securecode? Mastercard have developed a new anti-fraud scheme to reduce the risk of a customer's card being used fraudulently. It works by means of a secret password, much like your PIN, which you choose. From now on you will be asked to enter your password before your card can be used to make a purchase online. This means that even if someone does manage to get hold of your card details, they won't be able to use them online without knowing your password. How do I get my Password? If you have not already set up your password, the next time you attempt to deposit to Paddy Power using your credit or debit card, you will be prompted to register for Mastercard Securecode. You will be asked to input your card details and some other personal information to prove your identity. This varies by bank but may include information such as your date of birth, your mother's maiden name or your credit limit. Although you are inputting this information via the Paddy Power website, you are communicating directly with your bank through a secure link, so Paddy Power or anyone else does not see this information. You will also be asked to create a password. This password must include alphabetic characters and numbers. Once you have created the password you will be able to use this password for all future payments on any website, much like you use your PIN to make withdrawals at ATMs, or make purchases in shops. It is therefore important that you remember this password. If you do forget it, your bank can assist you in changing it. Does this Apply to all Cards? It depends on your bank when this will occur. If your bank has not yet implemented it, you will not be required to go through this process and can continue to deposit as normal. Once your bank enables Verified by Visa and Mastercard Securecode, you will be required to register your password. You can contact your bank for further details on when they plan to implement it.",

One of these options are Loss Limits. For instructions on how to set a Loss/Transfer limit, click here. What are Loss Limits?Loss Limits allow you to gain more control over your gambling. Loss Limits set a limit on the amount you can lose or transfer for a period of your choice. If you increase the amount or frequency, it will not take effect for 7 days. Decreases take immediate effect. How can I set Loss Limits on Games?You can set Loss Limits on Paddy Power by following these six simple steps:Important NotesLoss limits set within games will apply to Games and Mini Games. Games Loss Limits cover net losses (taking winnings into account) over a rolling period. Your Games Loss Limits start from the moment they are first set. They run for the time you choose (day, week, month or year) and then they are automatically re-set and begin again. If you try to remove or increase your limit, it will only take effect if you confirm this change after 7 days, e. g. £70 (€70) per 7 days is more restrictive than £20 (€20) per day. Any decrease in the limit will be applied immediately. Games Loss Limits only cover losses on the Games and Mini Games. However, if you have also set Main Loss Limits then these will also be applied to your Games and Mini Games betting. Examples If you set a Loss Limit on Games and Mini Games of £100 (€100) per week around Monday mid-day, your losses will be tracked from that point and you will be prevented from losing more than £100 (€100) on Games and Mini Games until the following Monday. Then the loss limits will be re-set for the following week. If you set an Arcade loss limit of £500 (€500) per month on the 31st August, your losses will be tracked from that point and you will be prevented from losing more than £500 (€500) on Games and Mini Games until the 30th September, the last day of the following month.

      "content": "All customers aged 18-24 have a Spend Budget on their account, so we’ve pulled together some handy information to help you understand your Spend Budget. Alternatively, our general Spend Budgets FAQs can be found here. What are Spend Budgets?Spend Budgets are just one of the tools we’ve introduced to help you keep your play fun. They’re a way of making sure you’re always in the driving seat. Your Budget is the net amount you can deposit into your account each month. It's based on your net deposits, which means that depositing will reduce the amount available and withdrawing will increase it. What’s the difference between Spend Budgets vs Deposit Limits?The main difference is that your Spend Budget is set automatically by us and your Deposit Limit is set by you. What happens if I have a Spend Budget and a Deposit Limit at the same time?In this case, the lower of the two remaining amounts will apply to your account. How does this affect me?If you’re aged between 18 and 24 you’ll get a notification when you login or go to My Account to advise that a Spend Budget has been set for you and how you can track your spend throughout any given month within the My Spend Budget hub. We’ll also send you an email to give you the heads up. How do I know how much I can deposit?Customers under 25 will have a Spend Budget of £/€500 per month. You can track your Spend Budget and your remaining amount online or in the app. What if I want a lower Spend Budget?Your Spend Budget is a monthly upper limit, however if this value isn’t right for you we have a number of tools available on site including our deposit and loss limits which you can tailor to match your desired spend on site in a given period. For further information and the option to apply more suitable controls for you, our Safer Gambling tools can be found here. What if I can afford to spend more than my limit?If you’d like us to increase your Spend Budget, you can get in touch online or through the app. This process can take a couple of days and you’ll need to provide some documents that show a higher Budget is sustainable. You can contact us here. What information would I need to provide?Simply log onto the app and our team will talk you through the types of documents you can provide. What happens if I withdraw cash?As Spend Budgets are based on your net deposit position, cash is just another form of withdrawal. Your Budget will increase if you withdraw. Can I get rid of my Spend Budget?For the moment, we’re not removing Spend Budgets from accounts. If you think your limit is too high, you can contact us and we would be happy to reduce it. If you think it’s too low, you can get in touch online or through the app.",

You can cancel your Snake Draft contest entry until the contest fills (e. g. in a 6-person Snake Draft, you can cancel your entry until the 6th person joins). Snake Draft contests start when filled (e. g. in a 6-person Snake Draft, the contest begins when the 6th person joins). After the last person joins, there is a 60-second buffer period before the first person is up to draft. If your Snake Draft contest does not fill in time to start and finish before slate lock, your entry fee is refunded. Lock TimesSnake Drafts must start and finish before the slate locks. The exact time that a Snake Draft must start by depends on the size of the contest and the slate lock time. The calculation is: Slate lock time - [(30 seconds) x (number of picks) + 60 seconds] = Latest possible Snake Draft start timeE. g. a 3-person Snake Draft for a 7 pm slate must begin by 6:50 pm (7 pm - [(30 seconds) x (18 picks) + 60 seconds] = 6:50 pm). The Basics of DraftingIn a Snake Draft, you draft your lineup in real time against your opponents. The pick order is random and reverses each round (e. g. if you have the first pick in round one, you will have the last pick in round two). You have 30 seconds to make each pick. If you do not make a pick in 30 seconds, a pick will be made for you. Once a player has been drafted, no one else may draft that player. You cannot edit your lineup after the Snake Draft ends. For Multi Game Slates: You and your opponents draft six players each for slates with two or more games. You must draft the following positions for slates with two or more games:You must draft players from at least two teamsYou may not pick more than four players from the same team. For Single Game SlatesYou and your opponents draft three players each for single-game slates. You must draft the following positions for single-game slates:You must draft players from both teams. The Queue and Auto-DraftWhen it is not your turn to pick, you can add players that you want to draft to your queue. If you turn on Auto-Draft, you will not receive push notifications, and picks will be automatically made for you based on:The top-ranked player in your queue, orThe highest-projected available player in the player list, if your queue is emptyIf you do not make a pick in your allotted time, a pick will be made for you, based on the same criteria. Protections Against Picking Injured PlayersPlayers with the following injury statuses will never be auto-picked for you:NFL: Injured Reserve / Not Active / OutNBA: Injured Reserve / Not Active / OutMLB: Injured List / Not Active / OutNHL: Injured Reserve / Not Active / OutPGA: Not Active / OutYou can manually draft players with these injury statuses after confirming your choice. ScoringPlayers in your Snake Draft lineups accrue fantasy points through the same scoring rules as standard Salary Cap contests.

      "content": "Below we have called out some of the most commonly queried rules around football markets. For the full set of football rules, read our rules page here. 90 Minute Betting: 90 minute betting is inclusive of all additional time played by the referee due to injuries and delays during the match. The full time result is the result for this market irrelevant of the number of minutes added on. In the event of a player not playing, all bets will be made void once they do not take any part in the match. If the player comes on they will be treated as a runner for bets upon which they can be successful ie. Anytime Goalscorer, Wincast. If a player has any opportunity to fulfil the bet they are counted as a runner, irrelevant of how long they have played.90-minute (normal-time) Rule: All bets in football are accepted on the basis that they are for 90 minute betting and extra time does not count for settlement purposes unless it has been clearly stated within the market. Example: Team A beats Team B 2-1 after extra time in a cup game. The match ended 1-1 after 90 minutes. The correct winning selection in the win-draw-win market is “Draw”. All bets on Team A will be losers despite them qualifying for the next round. We offer a market “To qualify for the next round” within cup games, this will take every eventuality into account. Own Goals: If the first goal is an own goal it does not count as a goal for settlement purposes of 1st goalscorer and subsequent markets attached to it. All bets on 1st goalscorer will therefore be settled on the 2nd goal. Own goals will not effect the settlement of any bets placed on correct score or other related markets. Time Intervals: We offer a wide range of markets based on time intervals in in-running bets. The first minute is 0:00 – 0:59. Example: A goal to be scored up to and including the 27th minute. If the goal is scored after 27:15 it will be counted as a loser as it was scored in the 28th minute. Postponements: If a match is postponed, or a match starts but is later abandoned, all undetermined bets will be voided as long as the match is not played to a finish before midnight local time on its scheduled date. Fixtures that are rearranged before the scheduled kick off date will not be regarded as postponements and all bets will stand, as long as the rescheduled date is within 72 hours of the original kick off time. For more information around postponements, read our article here. Popular Football betsScorecasts: A scorecast is a bet on a player to score the first goal along with predicting the correct score. If the player does not start the game and subsequently comes on after the first goal has been scored or takes no part at all the bet will be settled as a correct score single at the price offered on the scoreline at the time of bet placement. Note we do not fully void a scorecast if the player does not partake in the game. Scorecasts must be placed via a special market listed not as a correct score and first goalscorer double. By scrolling through the markets for a particular match the bottom market will generally be “Wincast” above this is market with 2 dropdown menus. You can place Scorecasts via this market. Simply select your first goalscorer from the left menu and score from the right menu. Clicking on the price offered on the right handside will generate the selection to the betslip. Wincast: This is a bet on a player to score in 90 minutes and the nominated team to win the game. It slightly differs to a scorecast in that it is completely voided if the player does not take part. It is not settled as a single on the team to win. Half Time/Full Time: You are backing one selection to be leading or for it to be a draw at half time and to win/draw the match. Example: Team A v Team B. The match is 1-1 Half Time and Team A ends up winning the game 2-1 the winning selection will be Draw/Team A. Accumulators: When placing an accumulator you are backing a stipulated number of teams all to win. If one is unsuccessful the bet will be treated as a loser. Accumulator bets are very simple to place. Simply individually select each selection you wish to back, generating them onto the betslip. Once this is done you have to put your stake in the box marked “accum. (1)” under the betting options heading. The one in brackets indicates that only one bet is being placed. The key to placing any multiple is to get every selection onto the betslip before thinking about stakes or bet permutations. For more information on Accumulators (Accas) read our article here. Insurebet First Goalscorer: Within this market you are having a bet on your selection to score first at slightly reduced odds compared to first goalscorer – win or each way. If your selection does not score the first goal but subsequently scores later in the match your stake will be refunded. Bet Builder: Bet builder allows you to combine multiple bets on the same game, such as over or under goals and corners, both teams to score, correct score, goalscorers, or even who you think could get carded or have a shot on target. All selections must win for the bet to be considered a winner. Even better - up to 4 bet builders on different matches can be combined as a Multi Bet Builder. For more information on Bet Builders, read our article here.",

If the goal is scored after 27:15 it will be counted as a loser as it was scored in the 28th minute.

      "content": "IntroductionWe use a 3rd party data provider called ‘Opta’ to settle our Shot & Shot on Target markets. Although Opta make every effort to ensure their data collection is as accurate as possible, they can sometimes review the statistics and make amendments. So, while it may appear as a shot on target on our site, this could change once the final review is complete. See below for a list of Opta definitions accompanied by short explanations. This will help you understand how your bet will be settled. Shot on Target Opta define a shot on target as any goal attempt that: Goes into the net regardless of intent. Is a clear attempt to score that would have gone into the net but for being saved by the goalkeeper or is stopped by a player who is the last line of defence with the goalkeeper having no chance of preventing the goal (last line block). Shots that are blocked by another player, who is not the last line of defence, are not deemed to be shots on target. Shots that hit any part of the frame around the goal are not counted as shots on target, unless the ball subsequently goes into the back of the net and is officially awarded as a goal. There are other examples where it isn’t easy to confirm whether a shot is deemed a shot on target or not. We have listed numerous different scenarios of shot types below and specified whether they are regarded as a shot on target or not. Please note this list is just a guide. The final decision is confirmed by Opta, and we settle all our markets based off their data: Shot Off Target A shot off target is defined as any clear attempt to score that: Goes over or wide of the goal without making contact with another player. Would have gone over or wide of the goal but for being stopped by a goalkeeper's save or by an outfield player. Directly hits the frame of the goal and a goal is not scored. Blocked shots are not counted as shots off target. Blocked Shot A blocked shot is defined as any clear attempt to score that: Includes shots blocked unintentionally by the shooter’s own team mate. Clearances off the line by an opposition player (last line blocks) are counted as shots on target and do not get counted as a blocked shot. Goal Assist For settlement purposes, a player will be deemed to have assisted a goal if OPTA adjudicates that they have done so. A goal assist means the final touch leading to the recipient of the ball scoring a goal. If the final touch is deflected by an opposition player, the initiator is only given a goal assist if the receiving player was likely to receive the ball without the deflection having taken place. If a player wins a penalty or a free kick that leads to a goal, it does not count as an assist. Body Part for Goals/Shots The following four body parts are collected: Right foot, left foot, head and other. Foot includes any connection with the leg. Location for Goals/Shots The position of the ball, when the shot is taken (shot origin): Inside or outside the 6-yard boxInside or outside the 18-yard boxAny event happening on a line, will be considered inside that area. For example, a shot on the 18-yard line will count as being inside the box",

Shots that hit any part of the frame around the goal are not counted as shots on target, unless the ball subsequently goes into the back of the net and is officially awarded as a goal. There are other examples where it isn’t easy to confirm whether a shot is deemed a shot on target or not. We have listed numerous different scenarios of shot types below and specified whether they are regarded as a shot on target or not. Please note this list is just a guide. The final decision is confirmed by Opta, and we settle all our markets based off their data: Shot Off Target A shot off target is defined as any clear attempt to score that: Goes over or wide of the goal without making contact with another player. Would have gone over or wide of the goal but for being stopped by a goalkeeper's save or by an outfield player.",

Blocked Shot A blocked shot is defined as any clear attempt to score that: Includes shots blocked unintentionally by the shooter’s own team mate. Clearances off the line by an opposition player (last line blocks) are counted as shots on target and do not get counted as a blocked shot. Goal Assist For settlement purposes, a player will be deemed to have assisted a goal if OPTA adjudicates that they have done so. A goal assist means the final touch leading to the recipient of the ball scoring a goal. If the final touch is deflected by an opposition player, the initiator is only given a goal assist if the receiving player was likely to receive the ball without the deflection having taken place.

There are a couple of things to look out for:Insurebet first goalscorerWithin this market you are having a bet on your selection to score first at slightly reduced odds compared to frst goalscorer - win or each way. If your selection does not score the first goal but subsequently scores later in the match your stake will be refunded. Own goals do not count for settlement purposes. Own goalsIf the first goal is an own goal it does not count as a goal for settlement purposes. All bets on first goalscorer will therefore be settled on the next goal scored. Own goals do not effect the settlement of any bets placed on correct score or other related markets. A goal will be considered an own goal if it is officially recognised as such on the day of the game - subsequent decisions by the dubious goals panels do not affect settlement. Your player doesn't start or is subbedIf your player doesn't start and there has already been a first goalscorer decided before they come on then your first goalscorer bet is void. If they come on and no first goalscorer has been decided yet then it is still a valid bet as they still have an opportunity to score the first goal. Each wayPaddypower offer each way goalscorer bets - we pay each way odds for five places. This can be 1/3, 1/4 or 1/5 the odds depending on the match. If your player doesn't score the first but does score 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th goal then you will be paid at the each way odds. Remember, own goals do not count so it is the first five goals that are scored disregarding any own goals. Anytime goalscorerYour bet is that your player will score at any time during the match. Usual 90 minutes rule apply and own goals do not count for settlement purposes. Your player doesn't start or is subbedIf a player has any opportunity to fulfil the bet they are counted as a runner, regardless of how long they have played. This means that if your player goes off injured in the first minute and hasn't scored they are deemed a loser; likewise, if your player comes off the bench late on and doesn't score they are also deemed a loser. Scorecast/WincastScorecast: A scorecast is predicting the first goalscorer and the correct score. Scorecasts must be placed via a special market listed not as a correct score and first goalscorer double. When you scroll down through the markets for a particular match the market at the bottom will generally be 'Wincast' above this is a market with two dropdown menus - this is where you place your Scorecast. Simply select your first goalscorer from the left menu and score from the right menu. Clicking on the price offered on the right-hand side will generate the selection to the betslip. We do not fully void a scorecast if the player does not partake in the game instead the bet is settled as a correct score single. The first goalscorer part of the bet is governed by the same rules as first goalscorer single bets - own goals do not count and if your player either comes on before the first goal is scored or goes off without scoring, the entire bet is deemed as a loser. Wincast: This is a bet on a player to score in 90 minutes and the nominated team to win the game. It slightly differs from a scorecast in that it is completely voided if the player does not take part, it is not settled as a single on the team to win. If a player plays any part in the game they are deemed to have been active and therefore the bet stands. Please see our soccer rules article for a list of all rules governing football betting.",

What can I do?If you think you've noticed an error in how your bet's been settled, we ask you to check the following before contacting us: 1) Has there been a Rule 4 applied to your bet due to a non-runner? For an explanation of Rule 4 read our Rule 4 Deductions article. 2) Is there a dead heat in the event that you have placed your bet on? For an explanation of a dead heat, read our Dead Heat article. 3) If your bet is a multiple, is one of the selections a non-runner? For an explanation of what a non runner is read our Non Runners article. 4) Please bear in mind that for football, we operate a ’90 minute rule’. The 90 minute Rule is applicable for all football bets (unless stated). It means that your bets will cover the full 90 minutes of the game (including any injury time) but not extra time or penalty shootouts.· The exceptions to this rule are in relation to situations where the referee ends the match before 90 minutes for reasons other than an abandonment, in these circumstances all markets will be settled based on the actual result when the game was concluded (excluding any extra-time), irrespective of whether the full 90 minutes was played. If you still feel the bet's been settled incorrectly, you may want to use our bet calculator here. Using the calculator you can input information such as the type of bet you have placed (E. G. a single, an accumulator, a Heinz etc) or how much you have staked and it will show you what you can expect to win. The calculator can also be adjusted to include each way terms, dead heats and rule 4 deductions. Failing all the above, please contact our Customer Services who will look into it for you, using the 'Message Us' button at the bottom of this article.",

Placing means it hasn’t won the race but it has finished in the places we pay out on. The number of ‘places’ we pay out on depends on the number of horses in the race and you will be able to see this information near the top of the market before you add your selection to your Betslip (just before we list all the runners):In the above example, we are paying out for first and second place only (1,2). If your horse/dog finishes in one of these positions, the place part of your bet will be paid at 1/4 of the odds on your betslip. How to Place an Each Way BetYou can place an Each Way Bet with Paddy Power in a few clicks. Once you have made your Horse selection (read our How to Place a Bet article if you are not sure how to do this) you need to tick the each way box on the bet slip:By selecting the Each Way box you will double your total stake as you are ultimately placing two bets: one for the horse to win and one for the horse to place (see ‘What is an each way bet’ above):Why haven’t I won as much as I thought I would? This could be for a number of reasons:A horse pulled out of the race (non-runner) and a rule 4 deduction has been appliedThere was a dead heatYou weren’t eligible for best odds guaranteedYou placed an each-way bet and not a win only bet. This information will be on the bet receipt. You may have miscalculated the returns. You can double check the returns due here. I’ve placed an each way accumulator or multiple and don’t understand the outcome?The important distinction to make with each way accumulators or multiples is that an each way bet is still only 2 bets - 1 for ALL selections to win and 1 for ALL selections to place. This means that if one of your selections does not go on to win or place - the whole bet is lost. For example, if you were to place a 6 horse each way accumulator and 5 horses won while the 6th horse placed – Your place accumulator would be a winning bet at reduced odds but as not all your horses finished in first place, the win accumulator would be a losing bet. This would then affect the total amount paid out to you.",

Perm (or Permutation) BettingIf you've made more than two selections, it's possible to 'perm' them in a bet. This allows you to bet on all the doubles in three selections, all the trebles in four selections or all the 4-folds in five selections etc. This is a convenient way to place a lot of multiple bets and can produce great winnings. For instance, if you place a perm bet of doubles from four selections you will receive some winnings if only two of your selections win. To get the maximum winnings from this type of bet, all your selections have to win. When you place your bet, you'll be shown a box which calculates your possible winnings* - please be aware that these are your maximum winnings and will only be achieved if all your selections win. * Please note that multiple returns shown on the bet slip are maximum potential returns, i. e. the most you can win. When a single dividend is part of the multiple, potential returns cannot be calculated and “n/a” is displayed in it's place.",

Perm (or Permutation) BettingIf you've made more than two selections, it's possible to 'perm' them in a bet. This allows you to bet on all the doubles in three selections, all the trebles in four selections or all the 4-folds in five selections etc. This is a convenient way to place a lot of multiple bets and can produce great winnings. For instance, if you place a perm bet of doubles from four selections you will receive some winnings if only two of your selections win. To get the maximum winnings from this type of bet, all your selections have to win. When you place your bet, you'll be shown a box which calculates your possible winnings* - please be aware that these are your maximum winnings and will only be achieved if all your selections win. * Please note that multiple returns shown on the bet slip are maximum potential returns, i. e. the most you can win. When a single dividend is part of the multiple, potential returns cannot be calculated and “n/a” is displayed in it's place.",

How to Change Odds FormatBelow is a table highlighting the difference between the two:FractionsWhenever you see two numbers separated by a slash, i. e. 10/1, this is a fractional betting odd. Fractional odds allow you to calculate how much money you will win on your bet in comparison to you stake. The number on the left(e. g. 10) is how much you will win. The number on the right is how much you need to stake. for every £/€1 you bet, you will win £/€9. This can also be calculated as 1 / (9 + 1) = 0.10 - There is a 10% chance that the event will happen. for every £/€1 you bet, you will win £/€1. This can also be calculated as 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.50 - There is a 50% chance that the event will happen. for every £/€4 you bet, you will win £/€1. This can also be calculated as 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.80 - There is a 80% chance that the event will happen. DecimalsWhenever you see odds displayed in numeric form i. e. 9.00, this is a decimal betting odd. Decimal odds allow you to calculate how much money you will be returned should your bet win.

      "content": "WHAT IS RULE 4?Rule 4 is simply a deduction that is made to winning bets, when the race is impacted by a horse not running. It is a fair method of recalculating bets that have already been placed when suddenly a horse is withdrawn. For example, if you bet on the second favourite to win a race at 5/1, but the favourite withdraws just before the race, then your chances of winning suddenly shoot up. To adjust for the non-runners, Rule 4 calculates what the true odds of each remaining horse now are. Don’t worry, you won’t have to do anything when Rule 4 kicks in but it’s worth being aware of the clause in case you’re banking on a specific return from the race. DOES RULE 4 AFFECT MY PAYOUT?If Rule 4 is implemented in a race you have bet on then your payout might be affected. However, this depends on the horse that withdrew and the size of the race. For example, if a horse priced at 33/1 withdraws from a race involving 18 runners then Rule 4 would not be implemented, as the effect on the rest of the field is minimal. However, were the 7/2 favourite to withdraw from a race at Cheltenham involving just seven runners then Rule 4 would kick in. Effectively, the shorter the odds of the non-runner, the bigger the Rule 4 deduction becomes. Your settled bet will show the Rule 4 deduction which has been applied. RULE 4 EXCEPTIONSYou can get a racing betting exception to Rule 4s if you bet on the ante-post markets. These are odds that are listed before the full race list is announced and are often used by punters looking to bet on races weeks and months in advance. HOW TO CALCULATE RULE 4Calculating Rule 4 can be tricky–and realistically you’re not expected to do it yourself! It all depends on the price of the non-runner and the strength of the field. However, as a general rule this table explains the basic Rule 4 deductions. Example:If you had a bet on a horse for £10 at 10/1 that went on to win, but in the same race the favourite (priced at 2/5) pulled out, your total return would be:Pre 'Rule 4'£10 x 10 = £100 (profit pre 'Rule 4')£100 + £10 = £110 (total return pre 'Rule 4')Post Rule 4£100 less 70% (70p in the £) = £30 (profit post 'Rule 4')£30 + £10 = £40 (total return post 'Rule 4')In races where more than one horse is withdrawn, the deduction will not exceed 90p per £1 (or 90%). You can also use the Paddy Power Bet Calculator and click on the Rule 4 button to help predict your potential payout.",

ExampleYou have backed Vicente for £5 Each Way at a price of 20/1. The each way terms of the race are six places at a fifth of the odds. He romps home to win so you will be paid as follows: £5 at 20/1 pays £105 (£5 x 20 = £100 plus your £5 stake back). A fifth of 20/1 is 4/1 (20 divided by 5) so the place part of the bet is paid as £5 at 4/1 = £25 (£5 x 4 = £20 plus your £5 stake back). WIN plus PLACE = £105 plus £25 = £130.

      "content": "Future Racing, otherwise known as Ante Post betting is when a market exists in advance of an event. This way you can place your bet well in advance of the race. For Future Racing betting, unless otherwise specified all selections that are Non-Runners are counted as losers. Generally, in horse racing or greyhound racing, Future Racing betting takes place before the final declarations of that race (usually 24-48 hours before the race), after this point, all bets are placed under Non-runner Money Back rules. How do I know if my bet is a Future Racing bet?Future Racing markets are available in the Future Racing tab in the Horse Racing section. Future Racing betting ceases at 10am on the day of the overnight declaration stage and all bets placed after that stage will be 'non-runner money back’, ie. your bet stake will be refunded if your horse fails to compete. Tattersalls Rule 4 may apply. Are there any exceptions to the Future Racing non-runner rules? In line with principals laid down by Tattersalls Rules of Racing, Future Racing bets will be void under the following circumstances, otherwise bets stand:If the race is abandoned or declared void. If the venue of the race is altered or postponed to a later date at a different track. If the race is postponed to a later date at the same track with entries totally reopened bets placed after the initial entries are void, but bets placed prior to the initial entry stage will stand. All bets will stand if a race is postponed to later date at the same track with the same entries, whether the bet was placed before or after the initial entries stage. If the horse is balloted out or eliminated under Jockey Club rules single bets will be void. In any such cases, accumulative Future Racing bets will stand on the remaining legs, at the prices laid on the selections in those races, with a double becoming a single, a treble becoming a double, etc. In the event of horses being withdrawn under Jockey Club/Turf Club rules, to limit the number of entries taken part, these horses shall be void. The liability of a layer against horses remaining will be reduced on both win and place parts of such bets, in accordance with the rate to be announced before the race by Tattersalls Committee, dependent on the odds currently available against the withdrawn horses at the time of withdrawal. All bets are executed at the price ruling at the time of handing in of the bet. We reserve the right to correct any palpable error. Win doubles, trebles, etc are calculated at full accumulative odds. Each-way doubles and trebles etc. are settled win-to-win, place-to-place, and for the place part of such bets, the fractional odds pertaining at the time of acceptance. Place only bets, conditional bets and forecast bets are not accepted for Future Racing. When the same selection is backed to win two or more races/events in Future Racing bets, special odds are applicable. These special odds will supersede the accumulative odds calculated from the individual event prices irrespective of the fact that the individual event prices may be endorsed on the slip. If special odds were not available, the stake will be divided equally as singles at the prices available at the time the bet was placed. Any horse that does not qualify for, or is expunged from a race, will be settled as a loser. Bets taken on a horse after they have not qualified by the applicable qualifying date will be voided.",

For Future Racing betting, unless otherwise specified all selections that are Non-Runners are counted as losers. Generally, in horse racing or greyhound racing, Future Racing betting takes place before the final declarations of that race (usually 24-48 hours before the race), after this point, all bets are placed under Non-runner Money Back rules. How do I know if my bet is a Future Racing bet?Future Racing markets are available in the Future Racing tab in the Horse Racing section. Future Racing betting ceases at 10am on the day of the overnight declaration stage and all bets placed after that stage will be 'non-runner money back’, ie. your bet stake will be refunded if your horse fails to compete.

      "content": "American Horse Racing - What you need to know!The first thing to remember when you are betting with us on US Racing is that dividends reported from US tracks are to a $2 stake. What this essentially means is that to get your returns you need to divide the reported dividend by two and then multiply it by your stake. A Handy ExampleYou place £10 on Paddy's Boy in Race 10 at Santa Anita and it romps home. You patiently wait for the dividend to come through as you know that US Racing cannot be settled until after the official result is known. At last you see a dividend of 10.6 - to find out your returns divide this by 2 and multiply by your stake:10.6/2 = 5.3 x 10 = Returns of £53. What else do I need to know?Place/Show bettingSo you think your horse has a chance but it may not win and you decide that place betting is the way to go. With US racing this is slightly different to what you might be used to. You need to look at the number of runners in the race:1-4 runners - Win Only5-7 runners - Place pool8+ runners - Show poolWhen you look at the results from a US track you will see a Win dividend, a Place Pool dividend and a Show Pool Dividend. If you have placed a Place/Show bet on the race and your horse has placed then if the race contains 5-7 runners you will be paid on the Place pool dividend (remember to divide that dividend by two) and if the race contains eight or more runners then you will be paid the Show Pool dividend. One more thing you might not be aware ofCoupled HorsesIn American racing, horses can be \"coupled\" from having the same owner. This means that out of both horses, whichever result is better counts as the result for both horses in all US Tote markets. This only applies to Tote markets. Any bets on any markets where we offer our own Fixed Odds price (including if you opt to take the Paddy Power SP) will be settled on the official result without coupling. In the majority of cases, the individual Fixed Odds prices will be greater than the \"coupled\" return.",

How to place a Scorecast & Anytime Wincast BetYou can place a Scorecast & Anytime Wincast bet with Paddy Power in a few clicks. All you need to do is follow these simple steps. ScorecastA Scorecast is predicting the first Goalscorer and the correct score. Scorecasts must be placed via a special market listed not as a correct score and first Goalscorer double. When you scroll down through the markets for a match, the market at the bottom will generally be 'Anytime Wincast', above this is a market with two drop down menus - this is where you place your Scorecast. Simply select your first Goalscorer from the left menu and score from the right menu. Clicking on the price offered on the right-hand side will generate the selection to the betslip. We do not fully void a Scorecast if the player does not partake in the game instead the bet is settled as a correct score single. The first Goalscorer part of the bet is governed by the same rules as first Goalscorer single bets - own goals do not count and if your player either comes on before the first goal is scored or goes off without scoring, the entire bet is deemed as a loser. Anytime WincastThis is a bet on a player to score in 90 minutes and the nominated team to win the game. It slightly differs from a Scorecast in that it is completely voided if the player does not take part, it is not settled as a single on the team to win. If a player plays any part in the game, he is deemed to have been active and therefore the bet stands.",

In the event of a horse being withdrawn, not under starter’s orders, stakes on that selection will be returned.

If you try to place such a bet, an error message will be displayed: If taken in error the bet will be settled at the \"special price\" for the double at the time of the bet. For example: €/£20 double Chelsea to win the FA Cup semi-final 1-0 @ 7/1 and Chelsea to qualify for the final @ 4/6 is settled as a €/£20 double at 7/1 (If Chelsea have won 1-0, they have automatically qualified for the final). However where the related parts of the bet are resolved at different times the bet will be settled as instructed, with the price for the second or subsequent legs being determined at each individual stage. Example: A €/£20 double Chelsea to win the semi-final of the FA Cup and Chelsea to win the FA Cup outright is settled as instructed with the price for Chelsea to win the FA Cup outright being the next price on offer by Paddy Power after the semi-final has been concluded. Should Chelsea lose either the semi-final or final then the bet is a loser. If any bets are accepted in error on the same selection or team to win multiple events we reserve the right to void such bets or to place them at a special price for the multiples indicated above Sometimes confusion arises regarding related contingencies in baseball bets. As games are played so regularly, it may appear that a team winning one night would effect the price of a team winning the next, and therefore bets on the two games couldn't be doubled as they are related. However in baseball, bookmakers will price the game depending on the starting pitcher. The starting pitcher rarely plays two games in a row, so it's essentially like two different sides are turning out. Therefore one result on one night doesn't affect the chance of a team winning the next night.",
